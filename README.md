Send Email if you miss phone call or SMS.

I write this because I always leave my phone in my dormitory. I will miss import phone call or SMS because this. I can receive e-mail. So, I need an Android application to send e-mail when someone try to connect me but my Android phone is not around. So strange demand! I must write it by my own.

I am not skilled Android developer and this project is very simple. It monitors broadcasts of missed calls and text messages and send a email automatically.
